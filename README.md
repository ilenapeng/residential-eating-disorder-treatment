# Residential Eating Disorder Treatment

This is the repository for my thesis on the expansion of residential eating disorder treatment centers.

## Repository contents
### Regulations - within the regulations folder
* download-fed-regulation.ipynb: Downloads 2021 state reports on regulations for adult mental health and substance use residential treatment centers from the Office of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Servicesâ€™s Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation. There are files for every state except Kentucky. The PDFs were then stacked to create all-state-regulations.pdf. To reduce the size of this GitHub repository, only the compiled PDF with all states has been uploaded. To access individual state reports, visit ````https://aspe.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/2021-08/StateBHCond-{State}.pdf```` The state name is in capital letters and if two words, is written without spaces or punctuation (example: NewYork, SouthDakota)
* The downloaded regulations were manually read and summarized in regulations.csv.

### Facility locations - within the facilities folder
* samhsa folder: Data from the SAMHSA Treatment Locator on May 25, 2022
    * 01-concat.ipynb: Stacks manually downloaded datasets from all states (these spreadsheets are located in the raw subfolder) to create a national dataset, which is samhsa-treatment-data.csv in the clean subfolder
    * 02-select-columns.ipynb: Selects the relevant columns and creates samhsa-treatment-data-subset-cols.csv in the clean subfolder
* carf folder: Data from the Commission on Accreditation of Rehabilitation Facilities on June 2, 2022
    * 01-carf-scrape.ipynb: Scrapes data from CARF - facility details, including addresses, are in carf-accredited-raw.csv and programs that the facilities actually offer are at programs-only-raw.csv. The program_offered column in the programs-only-raw.csv, which contained all programs offered, was then split out so that each program had its own column in programs-only-clean.csv.
    * 02-merge.ipynb: Merges facilities (carf-accredited-raw.csv) and programs (programs-only-clean.csv) files to create carf-accredited-merged.csv
    * 03-format-for-concat.ipynb: Creates and formats the dataset according to SAMHSA treatment locator data fields so the datasets can be concatenated later
* monte-nido folder: Data from Monte Nido and Affiliate's website as of June 3, 2022
    * Because SAMHSA and the Commission on Accreditation of Rehabilitation Facilities' data did not include Monte Nido facilities, I manually collected data from the website in monte-nido-raw.csv
    * 01-clean-and-concat.ipynb: Creates columns categorizing the programs available at each facility, following SAMHSA treatment locator data fields - this is saved into monte-nido-clean.csv. This data is then filtered to only contain facilities that offer residential treatment (As some Monte Nido facilities only offer outpatient treatment) and saved as monte-nido-for-concat.csv
* CONCAT-ALL folder: Concatenates all facilities from above folders into compiled-data.csv
